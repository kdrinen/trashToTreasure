Title: Galapagos Shirt

----

Text: It is a shirt that my dad bought when he was in the Galapagos probably 30 years ago. I am not sure when or why I got it from him. It has a massive stain on it but I hold on to it because I think it's amazing that a shirt could have lasted 30 years without any damage (besides the stain, which was my fault).
