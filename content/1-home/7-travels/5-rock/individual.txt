Title: Rock

Text: 

I studied and lived in Austria for 5 months and when I was there I picked up rocks all the damn time. I had to really decide which rocks I would bring home in the end. I would pick up a lot of heart shaped ones and send them to my loved ones. This rock specifically I think came from Elba, Italy. It's an island 30 minutes off the coast where my friend celebrated her 30th birthday, her boyfriend and boyfriend's sister lives there so we stayed with them. Some of the beaches were all little white pebbles. To be honest, the whereabouts of this rock being found is unknown but, I think that's where I got it. Anyway, I kept it in one of my coats and just played with it and rubbed it in my pocket. So it's been on a lot of journeys with me . It's kind of like a finger tip with a nail on the edge.
I don't know how much longer I'll hold onto it but I should just put it into one of my coat pockets and forget about it like before.
